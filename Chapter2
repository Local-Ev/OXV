Chapter 2: Programing actual Software

Date Started: 2025 June 28
Date Ended: N/A still working on it
i guess i have to Program now?

So i wanna add Variables or Arrays, this will be similar to Bash but here is an example if you dont know
Variable=10
Array=(
  "238"
  "458"
  "27"
)
Now this will be different in MY Language so it would be:
Variable 10
Array
  258
  458
  27
Reason is because well its gonna be needed in the DLL Tool, and it could be used to replace an Number
This is so that it matches the theme going on, and elimanating useless characters
Now you might be asking, how does the OXV Engine when used in an .oxv file know that its an variable? Simple when it dosent match ANY Command, but has an Number infront of it, or Numbers indented into it
Also im gonna make another command

CA <ArrayName> <NumberInList>
Example: CA Array 3
EXplanatory: This calls upon an number, in that Array, on the third Number in the List, which is 27

Now how would the Variable be used? well simple just replace an number with the name of an Variable
Technically this should be part of Chapter1 but who cares -_- i have to program 

Development, Date Started: July 3 2025 yes im still procrastinating an bit
Also im learning while Developing so this should speed up process :D
